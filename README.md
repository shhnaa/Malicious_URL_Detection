# Malicious_url_detection


This project focuses on the detection of malicious URLs using machine learning techniques.


## Introduction

In the age of the internet, identifying malicious URLs is crucial to maintaining cybersecurity. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify URLs as benign or malicious, aiding in the prevention of potential security threats.

## Features

- **URL Classification:** Automatically classify URLs into different categories (benign, defacement, phishing, malware).
- **Feature Extraction:** Extract various features from URLs, such as length, domain characteristics, and more.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Employ Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
